Ex. how to build and run eID identity provider in Centos/Redhat

Build the distro
================

- install JDK:
sudo yum install java-devel

- install Maven 3.0 (not newer versions)
wget
http://ftp.nluug.nl/internet/apache/maven/maven-3/3.0.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.5-bin.tar.gz

uncompress and add the env variables to your ~/.bashrc file
export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-3.0.5
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
export PATH=$M2:$PATH

- run maven
mvn clean install

- goto your chosen distro (i'll useg distro for mysql) and build it
mvn package

Using the distro
================

- unzip distro in /opt folder
- run scripts SQL to create database, permission and DDL.
- run JBOSS distro

$ pwd
/opt/eid-idp-mysql-distribution/jboss/bin
$ sudo bash run.sh -b 0.0.0.0

Warnings:

- be sure that ports 8009, 8080 and 8443 are free before running to avoid
  error.
- if you are running that in a VM, be sure the forwarding port is the same in
  guest and host (8443 in both cases) because is needed for redirection in
openID.
